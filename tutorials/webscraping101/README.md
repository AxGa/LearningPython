This directory contains scripts that demonstrate basic Python in a web-scraping context.

* *failed_banks_scrape.py* - download and parse a single Web page
* *fec_efiles_scrape.py* - make a POST request to fetch links for (and download) campaign finance reports 
* *la_election_scrape.py* - look for links and process those links, which then leads to more links
